# IMPORTANT: Do NOT exclude documentation or Docker files
# These should be available in Git but not needed in Docker build context
# However, removing them here would also remove them from Git, which we don't want

# Only exclude from Docker build what we absolutely don't need:
# - Compiled classes (we use JARs instead)
# - Test code (not needed in production)
# - IDE configuration
# - Build artifacts that are regenerated
